Beasts are the sort to feed indirectly, yet spectacularly. Their displays of sating their horrors are never subtle, as they often require the person or creature they are sating themselves upon to be fully aware. Conversely, this is a purely non-physical event, even if the Beast's method of eliciting such a response is violent. Beasts have an advantage over other templates in feeding in some respects, as any beast with a different hunger is treated as being an entirely different template from the other for purposes of determining repeat feeding penalties given that the methodologies of different hungers are extremely different. However, the spectacular nature of their feedings also means that the basic amount of health they remove from an area is greater than that of others templates. As a house rule on Metropolitan Midnight, the base satiety potential is always five dice, and considered a moderate example of feeding. However, one may choose to kill their victim in the process using +sate/kill. This creates a substantially greater impact, and it must be logged what sort of victim you are procuring. Regardless, this doubles the satiety potential's dicepool to ten, yet should never be done casually as it also reduces the health of the territory even more than a beast's usual baseline. Likewise, the presence of a murder will be obvious to anyone checking the area through the territory system.
