The beat system is used to track any gains of beats from varying sources. Breaking-point related beats are automatically added, as is the daily gain of beats for those who have been active inside of the week.

Commands:
	+beat (Show your beat log, +beats also works.)
	+beat/add <Type>=<Reason> (Add a beat for STing a scene, taking damage in one of your three rightmost health boxes, or participating in a plot. Types are ST, Damage, and Plot respectively.)
