The dice roller is a fairly simple thing to use. All you have to do is input the name or names of the statistics involved, separated by pluses or minuses as they add to or subtract from one another. Hence, rolling an unarmed attack would be, '+roll Strength + Brawl - <Opponent's Defense>' where you would substitute <Opponent's Defense' for the number of their actual defense rating. Switches (Items after a slash) may also be added such as /8 for 8-again, /9 for 9-again, /X for a lack of ten-again, /weak for a lack of ten-again and 1s subtracting from successes, /rote for rerolling the first time any die comes up a failure, and /advanced for rolling twice and taking the better result. Please note that only the highest modifier applies between 8-again, 9-again, and rote.

Commands:
	+roll[/<Switch>][/<Switch 2>] <Stat> [<+/-> <Stat 2>]..
