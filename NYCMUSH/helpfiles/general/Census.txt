The census command allows a player to view how many characters there are in existence, as well as how many there are that are approved and unapproved. The number in parentheses is the number of unapproved characters of that type, while the number not in parentheses is the number of approved characters of that type. Further information may be derived from using +census <group> such as +census bloodline, +census order, or +census tribe. +census may also be used for major statistics, such as wyrd, humanity, and so on.
