Certain social merits that you can take have a downside, or else upside depending on who you ask. Specifically, that of visibility. Visibility is a dice bonus that is added to or removed from any attempts to find your character's activities and other such details about their personal life. For all templates, add one die to any rolls to investigate them for every dot of resources, status, allies and contacts that they have above three. Naturally, fame adds to this roll as per the merit's drawback.
