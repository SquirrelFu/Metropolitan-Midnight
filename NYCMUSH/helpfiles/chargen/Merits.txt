Merits are rather simple here, but we do enforce the 10-dot limit in initial character creation. If you wish to save starting merit dots for your template's powerstat, you may use, "+setstat/powerstat <number of powerstat dots to purchase>" or zero if you wish to remove a previous purchase. Otherwise simply use, '+setstat/merit <Name>=<Rank>' and if you qualify for the merit it will automatically be added.
