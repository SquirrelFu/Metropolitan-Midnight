Although the multiple special kinds of, "Mortal+" templates (Atariya, Dreamers, Infected, Lost Boys, Plain, Psychic Vampires) are explicitly noted to be unintended for combination, no such thing is noted for anyone who holds psychic, or otherwise supernatural merits. Hence, we have decided to allow combinations. Some extra rules exist however, for templates more closely affiliated with full supernatural entities such as ghouls, wolfblooded, proximi, and more. Wolfblooded and sleepwalkers can in fact, still acquire psychic merits. Tells are far too limited in their own right, and sleepwalkers are defined almost entirely by immunity to the sleeping curse, nothing more. Proximi, fae-touched, and ghouls may not as they have limited access to their associated template's powers. Hunters may not either, as while they are still mortal they nevertheless have a unique set of powers and venues for developing these things too. 

Finally, vampires and the coil of zirnitra. Vampires cannot under any circumstances, take psychokinesis for fire or sunlight, or employ any combination of psychic merits to circumvent sunlight damage. Hence, while they may gain some extra advantages, they cannot change their basic nature overmuch in that regard.
