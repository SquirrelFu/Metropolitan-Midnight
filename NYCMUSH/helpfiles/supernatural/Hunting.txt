Territory basics

All areas have two qualities: Mood and health. Mood dictates how happy the people in the area are, and confers a dice bonus or penalty to certain actions taken within that territory. A number of templates require predation on humans to survive or at least thrive. Such as it is, health is the second element. Health dictates how badly an area is strained by the predations of a given template. If it gets too low, mood starts to drop. If it gets extremely low, NPC hunters or mortal organizations may begin to respond. Health is impacted for the most part, by beasts, vampires, psychic vampires, and changelings employing reaping. Please note that health drops more if type of template has been feeding in the area repeatedly. It doesn't matter if it's multiple members of the same template, repeated behavior draws attention. With the exception of beasts, a single feeding action does not necessarily represent a single mortal or animal fed from. Rather, it represents a timeframe in which the character devotes their attention to replenishing whatever resource they expend on a regular basis. All templates may add, "/check" to their unique feeding command to evaluate the state of a given area.
