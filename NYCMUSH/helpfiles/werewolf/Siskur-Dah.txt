The Siskur-Dah, or sacred hunt, is the central aspect of werewolf culture and life. Some cling to it more than others, but a werewolf's need to hunt is undeniable. A limited form of automation is present for the sacred hunt, allowing werewolves to recover essence easily without need for storyteller oversight. However, some requirements are in place. First, werewolves generally undertake the sacred hunt as a pack for a very good reason. For every dot of rank that the spirit in question has, a -2 penalty is imposed on the main actor. While others can aid them, this ultimately makes it unlikely to impossible to fell spirits alone unless you are a substantially accomplished individual. Second, spirits of no more than rank two may be hunted through the +hunt command. This is to prevent too much essence recovery, as well as to avoid trivializing major efforts as a single dice roll no matter how hefty the penalties may be. Third, at least one member of the pack MUST possess the Siskur-Dah rite. If no members do, then this action is impossible.
