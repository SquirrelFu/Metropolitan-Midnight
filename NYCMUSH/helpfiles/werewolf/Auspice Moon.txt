One's auspice moon may be a great source of essence, if it does not inspire Kuruth. If your harmony is anywhere from 7 to 3 dots and your auspice moon is in the sky (This may be checked with +weather) you will regain a point of essence every night as it is assumed your character is viewing their auspice moon without any difficulties given the consideration that wolves are not common in urban New York, nor would a werewolf howl regularly without good reason.
