As many other MUSHes, Metropolitan Midnight largely operates on a three-strikes system. Violations of the rules, particularly those that are performed unaware will have a strike recorded for the player who violated the rule. Some rules will generate two strikes, or even an automatic ban if violated. Automatically bannable offenses are largely constrained to attempting to include bestiality, pedophilia, or rape in a scene. While one can certainly approach these topics, their active depiction is something we cannot consent to, nor can we tolerate handling even the mention of these topics in a callous and uncaring manner. Further, we will not tolerate hate speech. This is defined as attempting to degrade another individual on the basis of race, religion, nationality, sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation. We are here to have fun, not to attack others verbally. Further, we will not tolerate threats of an out-of-character nature. Staff understands that yes, the setting of Chronicles of Darkness is unkind and harsh. Yet just because one can come across threats of violence or other harm in-character, that is no excuse to levy them against other players, versus characters. These last two offenses are enough to net you two strikes, possibly an automatic ban depending on context.
