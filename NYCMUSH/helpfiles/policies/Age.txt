For the sake of preventing trouble before it starts, EVERY character on the MUSH must be at least eighteen years old physically and mentally, when possible. Cases such as Prometheans in which the individual is physically and mentally a mature adult, yet potentially younger than one would consider an adult by time. In this case, it is acceptable to have such a character but in no other cases.
