So. Tinysex. Erotic Roleplay. Whatever you want to call it, it's gonna happen on the MUSH. Let's make some things clear however. Firstly, age restrictions are in place for all characters.(See: +help age). Secondly, we must request that any roleplay of an erotic nature that you take part in is done somewhere private. Be it a room you have controlled access to, a temporary room, or a similar location of secured nature that would require willful ignorance to enter without warning, you regardless cannot play out sexual scenes in public spaces. If you are caught doing so, it will count as a strike against you as the player. (See: +help strikes)

Another important thing to understand is that while the age limit is in play for character creation, there are many things that could possibly alter this in play. The time arcanum, life arcanum, and other things too. These are not acceptable loopholes, and if you are found to be engaging in sexual activity with a physically or mentally minor character who has been placed in such a state by some power, or else with an individual currently in an animal form, you will be BANNED. No exceptions. It doesn't matter if the individual is a gangrel using protean, or a thrysus making themselves look younger, it will still count as a permanent ban. Unfleshed are judged predominantly on mental capability and maturity, rather than physical age as many machines are only a few years old if that. That noted, Unfleshed if created MUST appear to be adults even if their actual age is far younger, and be so mentally as well.
