Powergaming can be an unclear subject with blurry lines. However for the most part, if you are focusing on a mechanical goal that comes at the expense of plot, you're likely powergamnig. Powergaming involves specifically, attempting to build a character with capabilities in mind to the extent that they make little to no sense on an in-character basis. Of course, with the rate of growth we have here on the MUSH, it's not unreasonable to assume that players will have their characters grow notably more quickly than the guidelines might expect. Yet at the same time, attempting to create a character with a narrow area of focus that defies plot is highly discouraged. Attempting to do so for the sake of competition with other players, doubly so. We are not here to, 'Win' or, 'Lose'. There is no win condition, or lose condition for Chronicles of Darkness. All there is, is making a story together. Characters may succeed or fail at goals, but they should not be created simply to succeed all the time, particularly not by putting down other players.
