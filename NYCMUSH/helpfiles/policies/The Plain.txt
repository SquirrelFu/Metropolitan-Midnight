Staff here at Metropolitan Midnight recognize that the Plain, while an excellent opportunity for characters to exist as paragons of self-sacrifice and nonviolence, have a great potential for abuse. Specifically, using them to hinder enemies while other allies attack. This is not in the spirit of the merit, nor is it allowed. Such abuses will be dealt with harshly, through the following punishments. First, the scene in which this occurs will be retconned. It will for all intents and purposes, never have happened. Second, the character who attempts to disable the victim will lose their, 'Plain Reader' merit and all merits that require it. While this is subject to the sanctity of merits as usual and thus allows the player to choose replacement merits, this player will be banned from playing a Plain character ever again, and it will count as a strike.
