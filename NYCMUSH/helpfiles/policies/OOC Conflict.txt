If you have a problem with another player and wish to talk it out without it becoming a massive incident directed to staff, this is fine. Interpersonal communication can solve many issues, and official action is not the answer to everything. Yet at the same time, we also cannot ignore the potential for an issue to escalate severely in absence of staff understanding what is going on. As such, when negotiating with other players, you must record a log. This log might never see the light of day rather admittedly, but you should still have it if conflict escalates. Remember, healthy communication is a great way to resolve conflicts.
