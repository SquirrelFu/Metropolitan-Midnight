If an individual is punished for breach of MUSH policies and at least three other corroborating individuals request that the punishment be rescinded, an appeal may be made. Appeals are done with the three or more individuals present alongside the staffer that made the decision, a staffer unrelated to the punishing staffer's duties, and the individual themselves. Hearings are to be conducted in an orderly fashion, with offense-worthy conduct both capable of bringing down punishments on the offender as well as severely harming the appealing individual's chances of getting their punishment removed. Staffers likewise, if found to be engaging in offensive behaviors as listed in the "Strikes" help file, can be punished.  If a case is regarding a behavior which brings down an automatic ban, staff reserves the right to deny an appeal.
